After exploring the London Housing Prices dataset, it seems as though Hackney has seen the greatest housing price increase comparatively to other London boroughs from 1998 to 2018, followed by Waltham Forest and Southwark. This was determined using each boroughâ€™s price ratio over the past twenty years, or their average housing price in 2018 divided by their average housing price in 1998. Another look at the percent change of the log-adjusted average price during that time frame confirms that the housing price in Hackney increased the most per year on average.
